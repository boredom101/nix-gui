*** List of Packages
Nixui package manager attempts to have a UI similar to synaptic package manager.
- It controls the inclusion of packages using checkboxes in a list view.
- It shows details surrounding each package in that same list view.
- It allows filtering by category.
- It has a description of each package in a bottom pane.
- It provides search functionality.

The nature of nix packages requires a few changes. E.g.
- A single package may be contained in multiple attribute sets such as =pkgs.python37Packages.requests=, =pkgs.python3Packages.requests=, =pkgs.pythonPackages.requests=, =(import <nixpkgs-unstable>).pythonPackages.requests=.
- A packages attributes can be overridden.
