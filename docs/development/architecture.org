Nix-Gui may be considered to have two components: the backend and the frontend.

The backend (=nixui/options=) reads information from both NixOS and the configuration path being edited, then converts them to data-structures useful for navigation, search, and editing. The backend maintains in-memory state for all changes and commits those changes to disk by writing to the configuration path.

The frontend (=nixui/graphics=) constructs various widgets comprising Nix-Gui and loads them with data from the backend. The frontend doesn't manage any edit state. All graphical "edits" send an update request to the backend.

* Backend
The backend handles three major tasks: configuration retrieval to initialize data-structures, in-memory configuration mutation, and configuration commitment. It provides APIs for frontend interaction, but doesn't concern itself with how the frontend renders any of its data.

** Loading the Option Tree Data-Structure
Nix-Gui queries information from the configuration path and =<nixpkgs>= in order to construct a data-structure (=nixui.options.option_tree.OptionTree=) mapping options and attributes to metadata (=nixui.options.option_tree.OptionData=) including their =NixType=, their =OptionDefinition='s:
- =_type=: A static python-object representation of the options type, informs the frontend of how =FieldWidget= should be generated and input checking should be performed.
- =system_default_definition=: Provided by =<nixpkgs>=, the default value if nothing is set in the configuration path.
- =configured_definition=: Provided by the configuration path, overrides =system_default_definition=.
- =in_memory_definition=: Undefined when the data-structure is loaded, can be mutated and later committed to disk.

=nixui/nix/lib.nix= (invoked by =nixui.options.nix_eval=) contains the function =get_all_nixos_options()= which is used to retrieve metadata to retrieve =OptionData= for the universe of NixOS options.

=nixui/options/parser.py= contains the function =get_all_option_values(module_path)= which
- retrieves all =attributePath = string representation of nix expression;= pairs in the file by parsing the =nixui.options.syntax_tree.SyntaxTree= constructed using =nix_dump_syntax_tree_json=.
- resolves the path of all =imports= and recurses

The result of =get_all_option_values= is used to set =OptionData.configured_definition= where applicable.

*** Caveat
The =OptionTree= has a node for each option in the option tree, as well as attributes that aren't actually options.

For example =users.ldap.loginPam= is a valid nix option. However its "parent", =users.ldap= isn't a valid option. Regardless, =users.ldap= has its own node in the =OptionTree=.

Likewise, =environment.etc."resolv.conf"= isn't an option, it is an attribute of the =environment.etc= option, and it will have a node in the =OptionTree=. This is true of the aforementioned =attribute set of submodules=, as well as =submodule= type options.

=list of= options are part of the option tree despite not having a proper attribute path, e.g. a list of allowed TCP ports in the firewall will have the element =networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts."[0]"= . This is not the same as setting =networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts."[0]" = <expression>=, rather, it is the equivalent of =networking.firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [<expression> ...]=.

*** =OptionDefinition=
Nix expression strings are immediately converted to =nixui.options.option_definition.OptionDefinition= Python objects. The =OptionDefinition= class provides methods to get the python representation of an expression string (e.g. an attribute set is converted to a dict, ="true;"= is converted to =True=).

=OptionDefinition='s also has the =_type= property, which returns the types the current definition is compatible with.

Additionally =OptionDefinition='s can be used to convert Python objects to nix expressions, which is useful for the "Commit Changes to Disk" section.

** State Management
Once constructed, the backend can handle updates to an =OptionDefinition= and attribute renaming.

All updates to the =OptionTree= coming from the frontend pass through =nixui.state_model.StateModel=, which is a layer on top of the =OptionTree= with =Update='s integrated. Each updating method results in an =Update= (an object containing information necessary to revert a change) being appended to =StateModel.update_history=.

The =StateModel='s updating methods include
- =record_update=: Update the =in_memory_definition= of an attribute in the =OptionTree=
- =rename_option=: Generally used to rename a submodule, e.g. =filesystems."/"= -> ="filesystems."/boot"=
- =add_new_option=: Generally used to add an attribute or element to a =submodule= or =list of=.
- =undo=: Revert the latest =Update= in =update_history=

** Commit Changes to Disk
The =StateModel= also provides the method =persist_updates=, which is just a helper function that
- retrieves changes from =OptionTree.iter_changes()=, an iterator that yields each attribute where the =in_memory_definition= and =configured_definition= differ
- calls =api.apply_update= (to be refactored), which extracts the =expression_string= from each changed =OptionDefinition= and calls =parser.inject_expressions()= with the map of attributes -> updated =expression_string='s.

*** Expression injection
The algorithm in =nixui.options.parser.inject_expressions= is as follows
- Given a module, construct =attribute_path_to_expression_node_mapping=, a mapping between the attribute path and the syntax tree expression node object (=parser.get_key_value_nodes=)
- For each option to be updated,
  - If the option is in =attribute_path_to_syntax_node_mapping=, call =SyntaxTree.replace= to replace the old expression node with the new expression node
  - Otherwise, inject the option definition at the top of the module.

We are left with a new SyntaxTree with updated / added option definitions. =SyntaxTree.to_string()= provides us the contents written to =module_path=.

* Frontend
The frontend renders a graphical tool for changing configurations. A primer on frontend functionality can be found at [[./usage.org#Interface]]

The Nav Interface (=nixui.graphics.nav_interface.OptionNavigationInterface=) is the main widget. It contains a layout with place-holders for three widgets:
- Navbar: View and update the URI.
- Navlist: A list of attribute paths which, if clicked, updates the URI.
- Options Editor: A container for a list of =FieldWidgets= which contains option/attribute metadata and editing widgets.

** URI Resolution
Each time the URI changes, the Nav Interface creates a new instance of each widget, replacing the old instance.

When loading a new URI,
- A Navbar is instantiated which displays the new URIs
- A Navlist is instantiated which displays the children of the attribute path, or search results. Selects the navlist item if the URI instructs to.
- An Options Editor is instantiated which either shows a list of Option Displays an item in the navlist is selected.

*** URI Format
There are currently two types of URIs, =config:option.path.here= and =search:search text here=.

** Navbar
The Navbar displays the URI and has four widgets, each of which results in a callback telling the Nav Interface to change the URI:
- Up Arrow: Change the URI from =config:foo.bar.baz= to =config:foo.bar=. (disabled for =search:= and top level =config:=)
- Back Arrow: Change the URI to the previous URI.
- URI Box: Shows a pretty format of the URI, allow for direct editing of the URI when clicked.
- Search Box: Change URI to =search:<entered text>=.

** Navlist
The Navlist displays navigable options based on the URI. If the URI is =config:parent.option.path=, the navlist will display each option which is a member of the set =parent.option.path=. If the URI is =search:<search string>=, the navlist will display each option matching the search.

If a Navlist item is clicked, the Nav Interface will load the clicked items URI.

There are a variety of Navlist types defined in =nixui.graphics.navlist=:
- =StaticAttrsOf=: immutable listing of attributes of the URI
- =DynamicAttrsOf=: mutable list of attributes. Useful for =attribute set of <t>= type options.
- =DynamicListOf=: mutable list elements, shown when a =list of <t>= type option is loaded.
- =SearchResultListDisplay=: immutable list of search results including details about why it matched the search. Searches are matched based on =Attribute Path=, =Type=, and =Description=.

** Options Editor
The Options Editor is comprised of an Option Display Group (=nixui.graphics.option_display_group.OptionDisplayGroupBox=), a layout containing one or many Option Displays (=nixui.graphics.option_display.GenericOptionDisplay=).

An Option Display is a tool for editing the value of a single option or attribute. The current value and option/attribute type impact how it is rendered.

A Field Widget (=nixui.graphics.field_widgets=) is the component of an Option Display which allows the user to edit the value of an option/attribute.

There are a variety of Field Widgets, and types of functionality for Field Widgets:
- Standard Field Widget: allows changes to =OptionDefinition.obj= which will be converted to a nix expression
- Expression Field Widget: allows changes to the nix expression itself (=OptionDefinition.expression_string=)
- Reference Field Widget: (NOT IMPLEMENTED) allows users to refer to a package, option, or other variable in scope, a simpler form of the Expression Field Widget.
- Redirect Field Widget: For =ListOf= and =AttrsOf=, changes the URI so the navlist is the editor for the elements / set members for the list / set.
